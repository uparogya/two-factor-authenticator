Two-Factor Authenticator is a block of code that, when utilized with other PHP applications, raises the security of an application. It uses HTTP cookies and session variables to store a randomly generated code in the local storage emailed to the userâ€™s address. When the user enters the correct code within a minute, the system opens the door to the application.
